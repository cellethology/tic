tests/data/test_export_representations.py

This file contains unit tests for the export_center_cell_with_representations method 
of the MicroE class (located in tic.data.microe).

Test Object Functionality:
    - export_center_cell_with_representations computes selected representations for the microenvironment 
      and attaches them as additional features to the center cell.
    - Representations include:
          1. raw_expression
          2. neighbor_composition
          3. nn_embedding
    - When model and device are provided, all representations are computed.
    - When model and device are missing, the nn_embedding representation should be skipped.
    
Tested Content:
    1. That when proper inputs (model and device) are provided, the center cellâ€™s additional_features 
       contain keys for "raw_expression", "neighbor_composition", and "nn_embedding" with expected values.
    2. That when model and device are not provided, the function logs a warning and skips computing "nn_embedding".
