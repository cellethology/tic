    """
    Export each MicroE's center cell as a row in an AnnData object, where:
      - X is the biomarker expression matrix (as in cell.to_anndata)
      - obs contains cell metadata (cell_id, cell_type, tissue_id, microe_neighbors_count)
      - obsm contains additional multidimensional representation features (e.g., 
        raw_expression, neighbor_composition, nn_embedding) computed at the microenvironment level.

    For each MicroE, the function:
      1. Calls export_center_cell_with_representations to compute and attach the extra representations.
      2. Uses the center cellâ€™s inherent biomarker expression to build X (as in cell.to_anndata).
      3. Extracts each requested representation from the center cell's additional_features.
         Each representation is flattened, and the arrays are padded (or trimmed) to the dimension
         determined by the first center cell that provides that representation.
      4. Constructs obs metadata for each center cell.
      5. Uses build_ann_data to create an AnnData object that preserves cell_id in obs.
         The biomarker expression matrix (X) is taken from the cell-level data, and the additional
         representations are stored in obsm under keys corresponding to the representation names.

    Returns:
      An AnnData object with:
         - X: biomarker expression matrix from the center cell.
         - obs: metadata for each center cell.
         - var: biomarker names.
         - obsm: includes "spatial" (cell positions) and additional keys for each representation.
         - uns: additional metadata (e.g. data_level, tissue_id).
